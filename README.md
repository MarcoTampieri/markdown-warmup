## Wich Website?
* **Name**: art.yale.edu
* **URL** : http://art.yale.edu/
* **Link** : [http://art.yale.edu/](http://art.yale.edu/)

## How did you find it?
Looked for sub-par websites on google.

## Why this website needs updates.
The website is supposed to reference to an art department of a prestigious university and looks like it's been made by a noobie.

## Is it on social networks?
Yes it is.

## Recommendations.
* Avoid the zen capibara background
* Try to avoid the checkered background pattern
* Choose a general colour/style theme for the website
* Make the different *divs* border look smoother.
